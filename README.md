The game you chose:
The name of the game is "Taylor's Game," and it is a puzzle. Sometimes this puzzle will require some educated guessing!

The rules of the game:

Your process for turning that game into a web application (wireframes, blockers/issues that popped up):

The most difficult thing for me was creating the grid. Although it is a simple matrix, I was very worried about having so many divs involved. Even after completion, I ended up finding some bugs when the grid is not a square shape (more rows or columns). This was due to a few issues regarding the rows and column variables being switched in such a way that the game still functioned properly in a square matrix.

A big problem I had was that I started coding too quickly. I should have spent more time in the design phase, but felt pressured by time. Because of this I had to go back later and refactor my code. I ended up drawing my UML diagram after the game was already functioning.
